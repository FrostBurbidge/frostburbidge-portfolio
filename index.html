								<h2>Minor Gods</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A turn based PvE game with roguelike elements in Godot engine using GDScript. The project is an in progress personal game I'm working on. I am mainly working as a programmer at present, though I also am working on the art and writing. Shown is the character ability system, which allows for easy creation of abilities due to a robust framework. The game has similar systems for characters, status effects, and levels. The process of making it is teaching me a lot about how to effectively structure large scale code to allow more effective creation of mechanics.</p>

								<h2>Boid Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>An Unreal Engine C++ simulation of bird-like objects (known as Boids). The project was made as part of a University assignment. I was primarily doing the programming, though I also created the UI and 3D models. Shown is the simulation running, with a section of the ai showing the decisionmaking process and the logic for some of the ai behaviours. I learned a lot about optimising code and ai behaviours while making this project.</p>

								<h2>Boarders</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A plants vs zombies inspired tower defense game made in Godot engine using GDScript. This was made for a game jam in a team, with me as the sole programmer and my teammates making the art and sound. Shown is some of the logic for placing towers. Doing a game jam like this helped improve my skills at rapidly prototyping games.</p>

								<h2>Labyrinth: Wayward Trials</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A legend of zelda inspired co-op game made in Unity using C#. This was made for a University assignment in a group, with me as the sole programmer and project manager, though I also assisted with some 3D modelling. Shown is some of the code for the character abilities, specifically for the wizard (the character wearing red in the game screenshot). I learned a lot about working in a team and working around the schedules and workflows of others.</p>

							<p>A character creation system in Unreal Engine using Blueprints and C++. This was made for a University assignment. I was primarily doing the programming, though I also created the UI and 3D models. Shown is a segment of the blueprints for changing the parts of the character and the C++ code for saving and loading the character. This taught me a lot about working in Unreal, especially about using blueprints with C++.</p>
